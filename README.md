Forest fire management system
Forests are the protectors of earth's ecological balance. Unfortunately, the forest fire is usually only observed when it has already spread over a large area, making its control and stoppage arduous and even impossible at times. The result is devastating loss and irreparable damage to the environment and atmosphere (30% of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere comes from forest fires) , in addition to irreparable damage to the ecology (huge amounts of smoke and carbon dioxide (CO2) in the atmosphere). Among other terrible consequences of forest fires are long-term disastrous effects such as impacts on local weather patterns, global warming, and extinction of rare species of the flora and fauna.
The following part presents a brief overview of automatic and semiautomatic detection and monitoring systems of fire protection in the world, experience with these systems in practical operation, and their evaluation in terms of efficiency, accuracy, versatility, and other key attributes.
